This is a custom circuit board I made to interface hobby servos with Lego Power Functions. It has an ATTINY84 microcontroller and a 5 V, 2.5 A buck converter. It supports up to two servos, and can be controlled either from a PF receiver or directly by IR remote. It is programmed in Arduino.

The bare PCB without components can be ordered from OSH Park: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/rSyxp330
